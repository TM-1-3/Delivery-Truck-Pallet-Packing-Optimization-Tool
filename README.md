## User Interface

- When starting the program, it will be displayed to the user a menu with the options `Exit`, which will terminate the program, and `Select Data Files`;
- If the second option is selected, all available `Data Files` (those in the same directory as the source code) will be displayed for the user to select;
- After selecting the Ô¨Åles, it will be shown the algorithmic approaches to solving the problem, for the user to choose between them, being also present an option to go back to the `Select Data Files` section;
- After performing the algorithm, the solution will be displayed to the user (including the associated total proÔ¨Åt) and an option for processing another dataset;

## Reading the Dataset

After the selection of the Ô¨Åles to process:

- `pair<vector<int>, vector<int>> extractPalletValues(const string& palletsFileName)` opens and reads each line of the `Pallets` Ô¨Åle, extracting each pallet‚Äôs `weight` and `profit` and inserting those into vectors `weights` and `profits` respectively, which in the end are returned inside a `pair` in order to be used by other functions;

- `int extractTruckCapacity(const string& truckFileName)` extracts and returns the truck‚Äôs maximum weight capacity, which is written in the corresponding `Truck` Ô¨Åle.

## Programming Approaches

### Brute-Force (Exhaustive)

- The program iterates through all subsets of the given items;
- For each subset, calculates the total `weight` and `profit`;
- If a subset's total weight is within the allowed capacity and its profit is greater than the current best, it updates the best subset;
- Outputs the indices, weights, and profits of the selected items in the best subset and the maximum total profit achievable without exceeding the capacity.

**Time Complexity:** `O(n 2^n)`  
**Space Complexity:** `O(n)`  

**Data Structures:**  
The brute force function receives 2 vectors (`profit` and `weight`) and an integer (`maximum capacity`).  
The output function receives the same 2 vectors, plus a vector of indices representing the items selected in the best subset and an integer representing the maximum profit.

### Dynamic Programming

#### Greedy Algorithm A

Sort pallets by increasing order of their `weight-to-profit` ratio and then pick the pallets while they do not surpass the truck‚Äôs maximum weight capacity.

#### Greedy Algorithm B

Sort pallets by increasing order of their `profits` and then pick the pallets while they still fit in the truck.

#### Approximation Algorithm

The two greedy approaches are not optimal, so we choose the best solution based on total `profit`.

**Time Complexity:** `O(n log n)`  
**Space Complexity:** `O(n)`  

**Data Structures:**  
Each Greedy Approach returns a `pair` with a vector of the selected items and the associated total `profit`.  
The Approximation Algorithm returns the elements of the `pair` related to the most proÔ¨Åtable solution.

### Integer Linear Programming

##### Item Struct

Stores data for each item including the index, `profit`, `weight`, and the `profit-to-weight ratio`. Sorts items in descending order.

#### Branch and Bound

Explores which items to include in the knapsack in an attempt to maximise the total `profit`, while pruning the unpromising branches.

#### knapsackILP

Main function to solve the `0/1 knapsack` problem using the Branch and Bound Integer Linear Programming approach.

**Time Complexity:** `O(n log n + 2^n)`  
**Space Complexity:** `O(n)`  

**Data Structures:**  
The Branch and Bound uses vectors (one of integers and one of `Items`) to store the current solution and items respectively.  
The `knapsackILP` uses vectors of integers to store the `profits`, `weights` and the current solution, and one of `Items` for the processed elements.
